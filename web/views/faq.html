   This is a sample AngularJS client application supporting both a Java middle tier/RDBMS backend as well as Elasticsearch

   <ul>
      <li>Elasticsearch makes a great development platform as it's the easiest to download, install, configure and run.
          This allows the repo to concentrate on sharing AngularJS knowledge and be the basis for business/CRUD applications.
